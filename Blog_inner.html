              Capital, supported by Tata 1mg, Unitus Ventures, and Axilor
              Ventures, along with participation from some incredible angels. We
              were clear that we would only work with investors who really
              understood the business and the non-linear paths to scale. Sudhir
              and the team at Celesta not only understood our business but
              proactively added to the vision and direction, and this made them
              our first choice in this crucial time. We are really excited about
              what this means for our vision of making diagnosis more accessible
              and accurate, and we invite you to check out the details of the
              raise

              Rather than simply announcing the funding in another press
              release, I want to shed more light on the current state of
              diagnosis for both patients and doctors; how we envision the
              future, and most importantly, how we intend to shape it.

            <p class="syed-and-i">
              Syed and I always maintain that we are accidental venture-funded
              entrepreneurs - TAM, SAM, and SOM were just rhyming words, nothing
              else. Our journey in 5C started after we personally experienced a
              problem with a late diagnostic report in Bangalore. The thought
              that hit us immediately was that if there were no Radiologists in
              the heart of Bangalore city, we could expect a far more acute
              shortage in Tier-2 cities. For the most part, Radiologists are
              concentrated where most of the demand (and affordability) is,
              which is in Metro cities. We saw first-hand how hospitals in
              non-metro cities were willing to work on a critical part of their
              clinical workflow with two first-time, earnest but inexperienced
              healthcare entrepreneurs.

            <p class="in-startup-parlance">
              In startup parlance, Bharat is Tier-2 India and beyond - and 5C
              was building for Bharat in our early days. Our clients were
              hospitals and diagnostic centers that did not have access to a
              Radiologist at all or had one coming in once every few days at
              best. We solved for access. In the backend, we built out a network
              of Radiologists from across the country who would give us chunks
              of their time in a day to interpret these scans coming in from
              across India.
            </p>
            <p class="blank-line2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="we-soon-realized">
              We soon realized that hospitals and diagnostic centers in Metro
              and Tier-1 cities also required us; not just for access, but for
              clear financial, operational, and clinical reasons. Deep clinical
              expertise, which is affordable and available on-demand became our
              calling card. We have had the pleasure of working with some of
              India's largest hospitals, hospital chains, and diagnostic
              centers. Some of them have incredibly high clinical standards that
              we needed to live up to, and this challenged us to get better. We
              saw how Teleradiology was almost a bad word in some of the centers
              we went to work with. They were scarred by fly-by-night operators
              looking to make a quick buck, international-focused players, or
              even large hospitals using them as training fodder and delivering
              sub-standard reports without realizing the impact on the patient.
              We knew that we had to focus on clinical excellence to be able to
              change the trajectory and the perception of the industry.

          <div class="in-hindsight-its-container">
            <p class="in-hindsight-its">
              In hindsight, it's obvious to us that our demand was able to scale
              only because our supply of radiologists working with us was
              steadily improving.
            </p>
            <p class="blank-line3">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="we-noticed-with">
              We noticed (with great pride) that radiologists across the board,
              including leading senior radiologists to young and ambitious
              freshers, chose to give up their physical practice space and
              become virtual consultants. Some reasons were obvious - these
              radiologists didn't need to navigate massive traffic snarls, they
              didn't have to physically meet people in these pandemic times, and
              because of not having to wait for patients, they could actually
              earn more money.
            </p>
            <p class="blank-line4">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="but-there-were">
              But there were a couple of other extremely relevant points.
              Firstly, the radiologists said that with the technology and
              quality guardrails that 5C provided, they were their best selves
              on our platform.
            </p>
            <p class="blank-line5">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="secondly-the-radiologists">
              Secondly, the radiologists felt the impact of the work they were
              doing - many of them said that the motivation for them to work
              with us was the fact that their expertise was now available to
              people across the country.
            </p>
            <p class="blank-line6">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="when-expertise-is">
              When expertise is empowered digitally to be better than ever
              before, physical presence is actually a disadvantage. We believe
              remote and digitally-enabled is the future of work for diagnostic
              experts in India and abroad as well.
            </p>
            <p class="blank-line7">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="you-can-expect">
              You can expect us to invest heavily in technologies that will
              improve clinical context, clinical decision making and clinical
              communication amongst various stakeholders, and cement remote,
              AI-augmented radiologists as the default standard for better
              diagnosis everywhere, be it in a small diagnostic center in Buxar
              or in a large tertiary hospital in Bangalore.

              <p class="the-sanskrit-word">
                The Sanskrit word Agnipariksha, which means ordeal by fire,
                signifies so much more. The fire transforms and cleanses. Our
                experience of working with some of the leading hospitals and
                their clinical staff can be described as our Agnipariksha - it
                made us an incredibly sharp and well-oiled clinical delivery
                machine. Our desire to make our diagnostic reports AAA
                (Accurate, Articulate, and Actionable) made us build technology
                that has never been seen in the field before. This had an
                interesting consequence, and it was our biggest learning - we
                were raising the bar for our clients and for our industry. Our
                clients in Damoh were getting the same incredible quality and
                speed of diagnosis that our demanding clients in Delhi were
                getting. What we had really built was India's first
                quality-assured diagnostic network. If you went to any center
                that had partnered with 5C, wherever you are, you would be
                assured of an on-time, accurate, and actionable diagnostic
                report. Quality is not about going to the biggest name anymore.
                Everybody everywhere deserves an assurance of quality.

              <p class="especially-today-when">
                Especially today, when hospitals are under pressure to deliver
                great clinical outcomes while also being under tremendous margin
                pressure, we found that we fit perfectly into their plans. We
                have seen so many of our customers being better prepared for
                emergencies because of our reports.

                When we think of platforms, we tend to think of tech. We have
                always taken the stand that people (users) make platforms
                successful. There are many distinct users on our platform -
                physicians, diagnosticians, and technicians - just to name a
                few. Platforms require each of these users to behave optimally
                in order to generate better outcomes. But user incentives are
                not always aligned. Physicians want to see more patients,
                radiographers want to complete scans faster and radiologists
                want to see more cases. How do we align their incentives to help
                each patient with the right diagnosis?
              </p>

              <p class="enter-the-idea">
                Enter the idea of communities, which form the bedrock of
                well-functioning platforms. Communities nudge members to act in
                the right way, and this helps align goals. It's important to add
                here that incentives need not be monetary alone. Social proof
                and certifications play an extremely important role.
              </p>

              <p class="our-radiologists-have">
                Our radiologists have always been part of a community, but we
                are expanding our efforts now. We are creating the largest
                community platform for radiographers and building social proof,
                certifications and accreditations as strong incentives. The
                radiographer community is incredible - they are hardworking,
                proud of their work, and keen to do better, always. We aim to
                invest in these user communities, and in turn, improve outcomes
                for everyone.

                  As you would now know, we are using our new dry powder to
                  invest in our data science and AI potential, to invest in
                  communities, and to expand our reach to every corner of India
                  - to every hospital and diagnostic center in the country. But

                  5C is not just a clinical delivery network, we are an
                  integrated network of quality-assured diagnostic centers
                  across India - present in 334 cities in 27 states. Be it in
                  India's largest private hospital, or a small X-Ray center in
                  BTM Layout, Bangalore, our level of diagnosis delivery remains
                  the same - always excellent. With all the superpowers we are
                  building, and with the support of our patient aggregator
                  partners led by Tata 1mg, we are building the book-and-pay
                  engine for diagnostics. This engine is being built on top of
                  the clinical delivery network that we have already built.
                  Revolutionizing diagnosis in India is one of the most exciting
                  digital opportunities this decade, and we are lucky to be
                  building in this space.
